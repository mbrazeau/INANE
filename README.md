# INANE

INANE is Not A Nexus Editor


INANE is free, open-source software which you are free to use, distribute, and modify with appropriate credit to the author(s) and for non-commercial purposes. The program is written using the Qt framework in Qt Creator.


INANE is not a Nexus file editor, but have no fear! It can import and export Nexus files.


## How do I get and use INANE?
Currently, INANE is in development. You will need to build it from the source code at present. To do that, you will first need to install Qt on your system. Then you should clone this repository to your machine and then run the python script (`getdeps.py`): 


    `python getdeps.py'
    `python getdeps.py build`


That should download and build all of the necessary libaries.

Open the INANE.pro file in Qt. This should then build in the straightforward manner, but please let me know if you have any trouble.
